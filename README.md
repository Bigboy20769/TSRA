# MSim3V_IA
MSim3V_IA is a self-contained computer program that is designed to aid in the development of materials that accurately simulate the x-ray interaction properties of a user-specified target material.  The overall scheme for tissue simulation that underlies this program and the other programs in the material simulation suite, along with descriptions of the algorithms used, are described in ref. 1.  The version of the program in this set is written in FORTRAN.  A somewhat more basic (fewer features) version written in C is also available.  The current version of the program uses the data from the McMaster et al. compilation2 to generate attenuation coefficients and their energy derivatives.  Work is under way to convert the program to use data generated by the NIST program XCOM3.
